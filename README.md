# RenAIssance Hackathon (Conducted by CSI club and sponsered by Worqhat API) GenAI project.

Hey, this is a GenAI for content creation project for RenAIssance Hackathon 2025 by CSI club and sponsered by Worqhat. 


# Track (problem statement) :

In this hackathon, the problem track is about 'Generative AI for social good' We need a Gen AI to generate text outputs, images and help people create bettter content with better social intentions.

Our goal is to create a GenAI to generate text, give out solutions and generate graphics for content creation and help influencers, online educators, businesses, charities etc to use this prototype AI for better social and contents.

# About the project :

Our GenAI model asks to choose between two option - one for 'text and other for 'image'.
After that model asks to give some or brief description, Taking input and the AI processes the request and gives out result. The result sometimes might not reach up-to-mark or fulfill user's expectation. We decided to keep it simple and straight-forward. We choose python as our main language for this project using procedual way to keep it simple and clean, we start with importing modules necessary for execution, sending requests and getting response from the Worqhat API. The program consists of if-elif-else ladder, functions, variables, try/except keywords, sending payloads to API, establishing connection with Worqhat API server before the actual code and finally closing connection.

# Guide and setup of our project (and how you can run it on your platform) :

So you want to know how it was setted up? First of all we have a laptop with latest python version installed, if you don't have python install then you can install it from python.org (latest version 3.12 or newer). Second we download VScode (virtual studio), it is an IDE (a platform interface for creating stuffs). After installation of both make sure you download git and GitHub(optional) on the device. Linux and MacOS have git installed in it by default to check go to terminal and paste this - "git --version" command to check the version, if you don't have it installed you can go to git and get it downloaded (Git is a free, open-source software for programmers). Now you have to download necessary extensions on vscode to do this check at left side there is an extension button and download python, gitlens and git extensions. Third go to home page again and on top click on view then terminal and use git commands to clone the python code and other files and make sure you have a '.venv' virtual enviorment for python as it is important for running code snippts, you can also simply paste the code and run it. It will ask you few questions and generate that you need.
